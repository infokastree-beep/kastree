# Tracked gaps

Known implementation gaps that are **accepted for now** but should not be forgotten.
Review this list before claiming a feature area is complete.

## Archival write paths

Only **clients** soft-delete currently writes to `archived_records`. See
`backend/app/routers/clients.py` module docstring for detail.

| Entity | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| `trial_balances` | `DELETE /trial-balances/{id}` specified in Product Spec §10.2 / §12.2 (snapshot on delete) — no delete handler or archive write yet. |
| `financial_statements` | `archived_records.entity_type` includes statements, but no delete/archive write path (statements are replaced in place on regenerate; no soft-delete column). |

## Clerk webhook payload persistence

Clerk webhook payloads are **not persisted** anywhere (unlike Stripe's
`subscription_events` table). After processing, the only audit trail is
structured application logs (`clerk_webhook_*` events in `app/routers/auth.py`).

**Not urgent.** If audit or replay becomes necessary, add a `clerk_webhook_events`
table mirroring `subscription_events`: Svix message id, event type, full payload
(JSONB), `processed_at`, and optional handler outcome. Until then, historical
delivery `type` fields cannot be reconstructed from the database alone.

## Webhook concurrency (test coverage)

`provision_first_signup` handles concurrent duplicate `organization.created`
deliveries via `IntegrityError` recovery, but the HTTP idempotency test only
covers the serialised “org already exists” path — not true parallel delivery.
See `backend/tests/test_api.py` (`test_duplicate_provision_first_signup_*`).

## Tier 4 OpenAI in sync BackgroundTasks (event-loop blocking)

`run_parse_and_map_job` (`backend/app/services/tb_pipeline.py`) invokes Tier 4
mapping via synchronous `OpenAI()` calls inside a sync `BackgroundTasks`
function. Fine when the call fails fast (e.g. missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`, as in
the walkthrough), but a genuine risk of blocking the entire async event loop if
a real key is set and a call is slow to respond or hangs.

**Before Tier 4 is used with a real key in anything beyond a one-off local
test:** make the LLM path properly async (e.g. `asyncio.to_thread` / executor
at minimum) or move parse/map to a real task queue per the Celery/Redis Month
3+ plan. See also `backend/app/services/mapper.py` (`apply_llm_tie_breaker`).

## Appendix A canonical set — real-world coverage (scope question)

The 19-line mappable canonical set in Appendix A (dropdown, mapper Tier 4,
`MAPPING_TIE_BREAKER_CANONICAL_LINES`) may be missing common real-world account
categories. Manual testing flagged likely gaps — **prepayments**, **accrued
income**, **deferred/unearned revenue**, and **provisions** — none of which
cleanly fit any existing canonical line today.

**Not a bug — a scope question for a future session.** Review against real
client trial balances (not synthetic test data) before deciding whether to expand
the canonical set. If expanded, scope the downstream changes: Statement Builder
line placement, validator rules, frontend dropdown/constants, and LLM tie-breaker
prompts must stay aligned.

## CreateClientForm step-1-only recovery (misleading empty state)

`CreateClientForm` is a two-step flow: step 1 creates the client group (`POST
/clients`); step 2 creates the first company (`POST /clients/{id}/companies`). If
a user completes step 1 but abandons or errors out before step 2, the client
group **persists** and remains visible — it is not a dead end. `ClientsList`
shows **0** in the Companies column; `ClientDetail` shows **0 companies** in
the header and an empty-state message.

The recovery action on `ClientDetail` is **semantically wrong**: the empty state
links to **+ New client** (`/clients/new`), which starts a **new** client group
rather than adding a company to the existing one. A user recovering from an
abandoned step 2 could create duplicate/orphaned client groups (each stuck at 0
companies) instead of finishing the one they started.

**Follow-up, not urgent.** Add a proper **Add company** action on `ClientDetail`
that calls `POST /clients/{id}/companies` directly from that page — not routed
through `CreateClientForm`'s two-step flow. Step 2 of create remains the happy
path for new client + first company; detail-page add company is the recovery
path for client groups with zero companies.

## Materiality thresholds — static defaults vs benchmark-based suggestion

Materiality thresholds are currently **static, manually entered values** (default
10% / 1000 absolute) with **no connection to the company's actual financial
profile**. Real accounting practice bases materiality on a percentage of a
relevant benchmark — profit before tax, revenue, or total assets, chosen based
on the company's situation — not a fixed number.

**Worth building:** auto-suggested thresholds derived from the company's own
first uploaded trial balance (e.g. 5% of profit before tax, falling back to 1% of
total assets if profit is small or negative), recalculated as new periods come
in, with **manual override always available**.

**Not urgent.** Static defaults are a reasonable MVP starting point since there
is no data to benchmark against before a first upload exists — but a real,
valuable improvement once there is usage data to validate against.

## Financial statements — no currency display (SOPL / SOFP / SOCIE)

Financial statements (SOPL, SOFP, SOCIE) display **no currency symbol or code
anywhere** — all figures render as plain numbers regardless of the company's
`functional_currency`. Not a data bug: currency is correctly stored and used for
the upload form and materiality inputs. This is purely a **display gap** in
`StatementsDashboard.tsx` and the Excel/PDF export templates.

Only became visible when a non-GBP (EUR) company was tested live for the first
time — every prior GBP-only walkthrough could not have surfaced this.

**Fix:** show the company's currency code or symbol in the statement header and/or
prefix amounts, consistently across the browser dashboard and all three export
formats.
